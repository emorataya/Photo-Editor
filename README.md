# Photo-Editor

This photo editor will allow users to browse the list of available directories and view the JPEG photos within each selected directory.
Along with the user being able to browse, the user can also apply various transformations to an image like changing the brightness level, inverting the colors, and making the photo use shades of a particular color.

# Implemented extra credit:
1. Use a Splitter control to allow the tree view and list view to be resized.
2. Add folder icons to all the folders in the tree view.
3. Add a “Save As...” button to the edit window that launches the Save common dialog box so the user can give a new name to the file.
